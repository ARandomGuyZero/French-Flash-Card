# French-Flash-Card
This project opens a window where a random French word pops up in screen. The user has three seconds to guess the word. If they succeed, the word is removed from the list. If not, the word is saved and can appear again. This also generates a file called words_to_learn.csv, where it storages all the words the user hasn't guessed yet.
